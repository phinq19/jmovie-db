# Introduction #
jMovieDB is an application that uses [metadatabase](https://code.google.com/p/metadatabase/) to easily support a different set of interfaces and exporters.

jMovieDB can find and display movies and series. The informations for them would be collected by TheMovieDB (for movies), TheTVDB (for series) and MediaInfo (for both).
